        "Data-to-text generation is an important field in NLP. The ability to translate raw structured data into more human-readable sentences is crucial as the sheer volume of data available to data scientists continues to grow. The cutting edge advances in data-to-text generation recently have utilized sequence-to-sequence encoder-decoder architecture ([Dusek and Jurcicek](https://aclanthology.org/P16-2008.pdf), 2016) to generate strings of readable text from “meaning representations” that tell the model what to include in the string, as well as where to include it. Improvements have since been made to this architecture, such as inclusion of higher-level sentence planning and content selection ([Puduppully et al.](https://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/AAAI/article/view/4668), 2019), imposition of pragmatic information preservation techniques and metrics ([Shen et al.](https://aclanthology.org/N19-1410.pdf), 2019), and employment of hierarchical encodings for the structured input data ([Rebuffel et al.](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-45439-5_5), 2020).\n",
        "\n",
        "Most of the developments in data-to-text generation have been focused on generating uniform, factual summary sentences from highly structured inputs (e.g., “The Atlanta Hawks (46-12) defeated the Orlando Magic (19-41) 95-88 on Monday” or “The three star coffee shop, The Eagle, gives families a mid-priced dining experience”). But what happens when the structured data input describes something that can be more ambiguous, like a movie? Can a data-to-text model give short descriptions of a movie plot based on its genre and more specific keywords related to its content? After all, much of the data that a model may need to summarize for different use cases may not be as fact-based as a sports game recap. For this project, I plan to use the popular [Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset?select=movies_metadata.csv) from Kaggle to train a sequence-to-sequence model and evaluate its performance in summarizing movie plots based on the information fed into it from the dataset."

Bergman and the Cinema starts with Frenzy from 1944 and ends with Saraband from 2003. It contains unique behind-the-scenes material from Bergman's private archive. Bergman and the Theatre is about some of Bergman's 125 theatrical stagings and about his delight with the TV medium with successes as Scenes from a marriage. In Bergman and Fårö Island he talks about the childhood that shaped him. He shows where he shot his film Persona and fell in love - and he lists his worst demons!\"),\n",

The film is set during the tumultuous 1960s, an era when everyone's values were turned inside out, shaken around, and reassembled. The central character is first-generation American Craig Wasson, who confounds his Yugoslavian father (Miklos Simon) by pursuing his own let-it-all-hang-out lifestyle. Wasson's best friends are athlete Jim Metzler and chubby Michael Huddleston; all pursue the affections of bewitching Jodi Thelan. Though they are obviously deeply in love with one another, Wasson and Thelan continue to foolishly avoid a long-term commitment as the sixties unfold around them. Four Friends calls for a fresher approach than the one offered by director Arthur Penn, whose handling of the material is much too pat and old-fashioned.\"),\n",
